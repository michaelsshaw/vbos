# vbos - very bad os - now with executables!

For-fun operating system created by me!

## Installation

You will need to deploy limine onto a filesystem image, the limine barebones
project will suffice for creating this. In addition, you must also have an
ext2 filesystem image.

Be sure to set `SERIAL=yes` at the top of your limine.cfg as well as the
`KERNEL_CMDLINE=` parameter `root=` as your root filesystem (not necessarily
the boot filesystem). Booting without the `root=` parameter will cause a panic
giving you a list of available block devices to mount. Only ext2 is supported
for mounting filesystems.

If you wish to use a partition scheme, it must be GPT. If not, mounting the bare
block device should (probably) work fine.
